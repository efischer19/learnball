Fantasy Football Machine Learning, an excuse to finally teach myself docker-type development

I'm playing around with docker-compose to set up a fantasy football machine learning thing.

Goals:
  - get a basic REST-type API for importing/reading the relevant statistics
    - this includes getting a basic webapp running using docker, mysql, and django
  - fire up some sort of crawler to import data I need
    - likely using beautifulsoup or something, I can't model my friends/competitor's draft styles without past data
    - note that I won't have the rights to distribute said data, so it will be kept secret and loaded into this open-source infrastructure
  - start machine learning
    - there's a LOT to potentially do here, let me get comfortable with the rest of it first.
