This file exists so that the directory will be here when you `git clone` the
repo.

This directory is where everything is configured to store files that are
either instance-specific, or otherwise unable to be shared as part of the main
github installation.

I keep most of my sql databases in here, as the data is manually sourced and/or
otherwise something I can't/won't distribute.
